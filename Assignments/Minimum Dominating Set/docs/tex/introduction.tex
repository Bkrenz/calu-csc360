\section{Introduction}

In this paper, we explore the Minimum Dominating Set of a Graph and how to find it.
The Minimum Domianting Set of a Graph is the Set of all nodes such that every node or one of its neighbors is in the set.

This paper is divided into the following sections. 
Section 2 contains background information on the Minimum Dominating Set.
Section 3 contains the algorithms used to solve for the Minimum Dominating Set.
Section 4 contains experimental data when running the algorithm.
Section 5 concludes the paper.
