# Minimum Domating Set of a Graph

The minimum dominating set of a graph is the set of vertices for which each vertex or one of its neighbors is in the graph.
The best known runtime for this algorithm to find the minimum set is O(n^2).

This project explores and implementation of the algorithm, as well as an implementation of an approximation algorithm.
Data is collected and compared for runtimes between these two algorithms, to determine their comparative efficiency.
